# Word Guess

This is an academic project of a word-guess game using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The word is chosen randomly from a word pool (database JS object) and it's about an animal.

In the middle of the page there's a covered box that contains the animal's picture. When the user starts to guess the letters the image
will be partially revealed to help him/her out.

# How to Play

You can download this project and open the `index.html` file, it will open your browser and you can start playing it.

You will find the **Instructions** header in the home page, click on it to expand the content. Anyway, the instructions go as follows:

1. Guess a letter (case insensitive). You can press `Enter`to submit your input, or click on the `Ok` button.

2. If the word contains the above letter, it'll be permanently displayed at its position, and part of the image will be displayed.

3. If the word does not contains it, then you lose an attempt and part of the image will be displayed to help you.

4. Remember that you have limited attempts!! The goal is to find all the correct letters which form the word of the animal showed in the
   picture!!
