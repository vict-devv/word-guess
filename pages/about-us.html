      <h2>The Author</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm
        <a
          href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-ferreira-araujo-327049156/"
          target="_blank"
          >Victor Ferreira Araújo</a
        >, and I developed this project as a student at
        <a href="https://www.conestogac.on.ca/" target="_blank"
          >Conestoga College</a
        >, Canada. I was born in Brazil and worked as a Software Engineer for a
        couple of years before becoming a student again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I'm living in Kitchener, Ontario, and I want to sum up my previous
        professional experiences with my academic ones to do my best in the
        Canadian IT market.
      </p>

      <h2>Program and Course</h2>
      <p>
        The program I'm taking is Web Development ( PROG8661 ), and the course
        related to this project is JavaScript Winter 2025 Section 2,
        administrated by
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnjprinz/" target="_blank"
          >Professor John Prinz</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>The Project</h2>
      <p>
        Professor John requested this project as an assignment, and the goal is
        to use the course's content to build any web app, in this case, a
        word-guess/picture-reveal game using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this project, I used the
        <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery library</a> at
        version 3.7.1-slim to handle events, elements selection, DOM
        manipulation and so on. This was an amazing project for me to get a
        hands-ok practice with the Web's most important triplet ( HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript ).
      </p>
      <p>Thank you!!</p>
